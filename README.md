# Pointers
##Code 1
1. Start
2. Declare variables: int i, j, float fl (integer and float variables), int* int_ptr (pointer to an integer), float* float_ptr (pointer to a float), char* char_ptr (pointer to a character)
3. Assign values to i and fl: i = 5, fl = 3.14
4. Assign the address of variable i to the integer pointer int_ptr: int_ptr = &i
5. Output: "*int_ptr " followed by the value pointed to by int_ptr (dereferencing int_ptr) and a newline
6. Output: "&i=" followed by the memory address of variable i and a newline
7. Output: "int_ptr = " followed by the value stored in int_ptr (memory address of variable i) and a newline
8. End
The program starts and declares necessary variables including integer and float variables, pointers to integer and float, and a pointer to a character.
The integer variable i is assigned the value 5, and the float variable fl is assigned the value 3.14.
The address of variable i is assigned to the integer pointer int_ptr.
The program outputs the value pointed to by int_ptr (dereferencing), the memory address of variable i, and the value stored in int_ptr (which is the memory address of i).
The program demonstrates the use of pointers by storing the memory address of a variable and then accessing the value stored at that memory location.
The program ends after performing the pointer operations and displaying the results.
